| < 1.0   | :x:                | End of life   |

**Note**: As ReliantType is actively developed, we maintain support for the current minor version series (2.1.x) and the most recent major version (2.0.x) for long-term support. The current stable release is **2.1.2**.

## Security Features

ReliantType incorporates several built-in security measures:

- **Secure Regex Patterns**: All string operations use secure regex patterns instead of potentially vulnerable methods
- **Input Sanitization**: Automatic validation prevents common injection attacks
- **Type Safety**: Runtime validation ensures data integrity and prevents type confusion attacks
- **Depth Limiting**: Built-in protection against deeply nested objects (default limit: 500 levels, configurable)
- **Memory Safety**: Optimized validation paths prevent memory exhaustion attacks

## Security Best Practices

When using ReliantType in production:

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest stable version
2. **Validate Depth**: Configure appropriate depth limits for nested objects
3. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for unusual validation patterns that might indicate attacks
4. **Sanitize Inputs**: Use ReliantType as part of a comprehensive input validation strategy
5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to prevent information leakage

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- Security vulnerabilities are not publicly disclosed until fixes are available
- We coordinate with security researchers to ensure proper timeline and communication
- We maintain transparency about security issues through our security advisories
- We provide migration guides when security fixes require breaking changes
